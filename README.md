# Playerbots Module

This is a WIP Playerbots module for AzerothCore based on IKE3 Playerbots. Code is port from: https://github.com/ZhengPeiRu21/mod-playerbots
 
I tried to fix many bugs based on the source code, making this playable, and tried to add more interesting functions, such as automatic positioning of the robot to deal with different raid bosses.

You can use this addon to better control the bot and avoid typing a lot of commands: https://github.com/liyunfan1223/unbot-addon

These Playerbots use actual player data, so it is capable to use own alts and play with own party, level up characters, and more. It is mostly usuable but still has many bugs that need to be resolved. Also please note that including this module will currently significantly increase compilation time for AzerothCore.

Please kindly note that this requires some custom changes to AzerothCore, so it is necessary to compile with a custom branch from my fork:

If encounter errors and crashes, please post as Github issues so that we can resolve them and improve this project together!
